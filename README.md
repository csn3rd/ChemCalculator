# Chem Calculator

<b>Are you struggling in your chemistry class with finding the proper amount of sig figs in a number? How about calculating the molar mass of a simple chemical? Well, our app, Chem Calculator, can do both! </b><br>
<h2>Background</h2>
This app, designed by Ryan Mohta and Jonathan Ho from Cupertino High School, works on Android devices and is designed to be as simple to use as possible. All you need to do is enter a number or a chemical* and the app will tell you how many sig figs are in that number or what the molar mass of the chemical is, depending on the option you put in.
<h2>Features</h2>
  -Simple operation: just type in a number for the sig fig calculator or a chemical for the molar mass calculator and click "Go" <br>
	-Time saving: no need to use your calculator and look at a periodic table to calculate molar mass <br>
	-Clean, easy to use UI
<h2>Some capibilities we hope to include in future updates are: </h2>
  -Performing simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and formatting the answer to the correct amount of sig figs. <br>
  -Adding the ability to specify the number as a constant with infinite sig figs or as a measurement <br>
  -Allow users to calculate molar mass of more complex chemicals with parenthesis and coefficients <br>
	-Allow users to calculate molar mass of multiple chemicals or an entire equation (this may not happen soon, give us some time!) <br>
	-Becoming a unicorn
<hr>
We designed this app at MLH Local Hack Day on December 3, 2016, a worldwide hackathon celebrating the hacker community. Our current version is 1.0 <br>
*As of our initial release this app can only calculate molar mass of simple chemicals not including parenthesis or coefficients. We hope to add these capibilities in the future though! ;)
